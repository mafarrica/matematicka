## Hackathon Bounties

Hackbot: app is deployed at [website](https://matematicka.streamlit.app). The embedded url "https://hackbot.co/dashboard/will-main-party-education" shows hackbot's report on our solidity contract.

Vyper: under src/Matematicka.vy we can find the contract written in the Vyper language.


## About Matematicka
The Matematicka project is a comprehensive Solidity-based smart contract system developed using the Foundry framework. It is designed to offer a streamlined development and testing environment for smart contracts, leveraging Foundry's advanced features to ensure efficient and reliable execution. This project encapsulates the best practices in Solidity development, including modular contract structures, rigorous testing, and security-focused methodologies.

At its core, the Matematicka project consists of a Solidity contract to promote and enhance mathematical and science education through a decentralized and transparent protocol and currency. Future integrations of this project can be used to register, promote, and distribute transparent certificates, currency, recognizing and verifying the endeavours of individuals towards this cause in an on-chain setting.  

To further enhance the robustness of the project, Hackbot CI integration has been incorporated. Hackbot is a security-focused tool that scans smart contracts for vulnerabilities, helping developers identify and mitigate potential issues before deployment. This integration ensures that the Matematicka project adheres to the highest security standards and minimizes risks associated with smart contract exploits.

Overall, Matematicka is more than just a Solidity projectâ€”it's a testament to the importance of decentralizing education for all, while maintaining a secure, well-structured, and efficiently tested smart contract.


## Integration of GatlingX's Hackbot

As part of our commitment to security, we integrated GatlingX's Hackbot into this project. The goal was to leverage Hackbot's automated vulnerability scanning to identify and address potential security weaknesses in our smart contracts.

However, due to an issue related to the Hackbot server, we were unable to successfully execute the scans. The server-side issue prevented us from obtaining scan results. We remain hopeful that this problem will be resolved in the future, allowing us to fully utilize Hackbot's security analysis capabilities.

Overall, the attempted integration of Hackbot underscores our proactive approach to smart contract security, reinforcing our focus on maintaining best practices in Solidity development.

Matematicka is more than just a Solidity project, it's a testament to the importance of secure, well-structured, and efficiently tested smart contract development. Whether you're looking to understand Foundry-based Solidity projects, explore best practices in smart contract security, or simply appreciate a well-organized codebase, Matematicka serves as a solid reference point.
