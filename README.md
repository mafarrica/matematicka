## Matematicka
The Matematicka project is a comprehensive Solidity-based smart contract system developed using the Foundry framework. It is designed to offer a streamlined development and testing environment for smart contracts, leveraging Foundry's advanced features to ensure efficient and reliable execution. This project encapsulates the best practices in Solidity development, including modular contract structures, rigorous testing, and security-focused methodologies.

At its core, the Matematicka project consists of multiple Solidity contracts that interact seamlessly to provide the desired functionality. These contracts are housed within the src/ directory, while corresponding test scripts reside in test/, ensuring that each aspect of the project is thoroughly vetted before deployment.

To further enhance the robustness of the project, Hackbot CI integration has been incorporated. Hackbot is a security-focused tool that scans smart contracts for vulnerabilities, helping developers identify and mitigate potential issues before deployment. This integration ensures that the Matematicka project adheres to the highest security standards and minimizes risks associated with smart contract exploits.

Beyond security, the project also emphasizes automated workflows. A pre-configured GitHub Actions workflow facilitates continuous integration, making it easier for developers to run security scans and validate changes before merging them into the main codebase. The repository is structured to support a streamlined development process, with clear separation between contract logic, testing, and deployment scripts.

Overall, Matematicka is more than just a Solidity project—it's a testament to the importance of secure, well-structured, and efficiently tested smart contract development. Whether you're looking to understand Foundry-based Solidity projects, explore best practices in smart contract security, or simply appreciate a well-organized codebase, Matematicka serves as a solid reference point.


## Integration of GatlingX's Hackbot

As part of our commitment to security, we integrated GatlingX's Hackbot into this project. The goal was to leverage Hackbot's automated vulnerability scanning to identify and address potential security weaknesses in our smart contracts.

However, due to an issue related to the Hackbot server, we were unable to successfully execute the scans. Despite configuring the API keys and setting up the appropriate workflows, the server-side issue prevented us from obtaining scan results. We remain hopeful that this problem will be resolved in the future, allowing us to fully utilize Hackbot's security analysis capabilities.

Overall, the attempted integration of Hackbot underscores our proactive approach to smart contract security, reinforcing our focus on maintaining best practices in Solidity development.

Matematicka is more than just a Solidity project—it's a testament to the importance of secure, well-structured, and efficiently tested smart contract development.
